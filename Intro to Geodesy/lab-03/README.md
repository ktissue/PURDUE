# CE597 - Mapping Projection and Geometric Geodesy

## Lab No. 3 - Differential Geometry: Plate Caree

Submit a jupyter notebook that addresses below questions. The submitted notebook should be self executable within the current repository.

**Note: Assume the Earth is sphere and the radius of the Earth is 6371 km**

1. **(5/5 points)** Select the same original 11 points on the globe as in Lab 1 and Lab 2 - one point in each octant, NP, SP, and your PoB - then print 2 tables.
  - First table should contain spherical coordinates in DMS format (8 columns) with millimeter accuracy.
  - Second table should contain cartesian coordinates in meter format (4 columns) with millimeter accuracy.
  - Make it sure the DMS format is the only input to the program.
  - Each table should contain header.
  - Each table should contain **name** column.
2. **(5/5 points)** With the same program to plot the 11 points, coast line, and grid lines, plot them on a map using Plate Caree mapping prescription.
  - Plate Caree mapping preiscription: *Xm = lambda (deg), Ym = psi (deg)*
  - Both coast line and grid line file is given in 3 columns where first column can be ignored, second column = latitude in arcmin, and thrid column = longitude in arcmin format.
3. **(20/20 points)** Select the 15 x 15 degree square of meridian and parallel circle that encloses your PoB, and call this square ABCD. Through measurements and calculation, determine the scale, i.e., the representative fraction of your map for the lines AB, AC, and AD. Show detailed calculations and measurements in the RW and MW.
  - Assuming unit of Xm and Ym is cm.
4. **(20/20 points)** What is your final conclusion about the scale of this map? Explain.

# Final score: 10/10
