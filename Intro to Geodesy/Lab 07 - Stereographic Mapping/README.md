## Lab 7 - Stereographic Mapping

In Lab 3, 4, 5, and 6, we employed various mapping prescription which are defined on the Cartesian coordinate frame. In this lab, you will create different maps using stereographic mapping prescriptions which are defined in the Polar coordinate frame.

1.	(**8/10 points**) Plot grid line, coast line, and your PoB using normal aspect PC, SF, M and transverse PC, SF, MC mapping prescription. You need to provide 6 maps (PC, SF, MC, TPC, TSF, TMC) here. Use only points that are between -80° and 80° latitude for Mercator (normal and transverse) mapping.
  - **NOTE: Missing axis('euqal') in your maps**
2.	(**18/20 points**) Plot grid line, coast line, and your PoB using normal stereographic and oblique stereographic mapping prescription. You need to provide 2 maps (ST, OST) here. Use only points that are between 0° and 105° colatitude for these maps.
  - **NOTE: Missing axis('euqal') in your maps**
3.	(**20/20 points**) For all maps (8 maps), select a 15°x15° “square” ABCD that contains your POB. Use three lines: EW(AB), NS(AD), NE(AC), e.g. between two “grid” points forming the intersections between meridians and parallel circles. Calculate the scales (NS, NE, EW direction) (representative fraction, e.g. 1:2,000,000) of all maps. Show your measurements in the map, and report also in your discussion, too. Calculate the real world distances and the scales inside your Python code.

4.	(**10/10 points**) Generate 8 tables: one for every map. Each table must have 3 columns: Direction (NS, NE, EW), Scales, %. Set your NS scale to 100 %.

5.	(**10/10 points**) Discuss the scales using the table generated from 4. What do you (not) like about them as an engineer/surveyor?

## Final score: (8 + 18 + 20 + 10 + 10) / 70 = 9.43
