## Lab 10 - Radius of Curvatures of NAD83 Ellipsoid

For every phi with 10 degree spacing between -90 and 90 degree, calculate M, N, K, phi - psi. 

1. (**10 points**) Create a table that shows 5 columns: phi, M, N, K, phi-psi. 

2. (**10 points**) Create 2 figures. One figure that shows phi on x-axis and M, N, K on y-axis, and the other figure shows phi on x-axis and phi-psi on y-axis.
