## Introduce yourself.

* Your name: Kevan Tissue
* Your email: ktissue@purdue.edu
* Your country of origin: United States of America
* Tell me about yourself: I am currently a second-year Master's student studying Geomatics at Purdue University. I was born and raised just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana and I received a Bachelor's degree in Construction Management from Louisiana State University. After working in the construction industry for about 6 years, I realized that I wasn't satisfied with my job, so I quit and made the decision to go back to school in pursuit of a more challenging career. Before returning to school, however, I took some time to travel to several places around the world. I also spent some time commercial salmon fishing in Alaska. Following my interests in Surveying, I stumbled into the world of Geomatics and I've been fascinated with it ever since. Looking into my options for schools, I found only a handful with graduate level degrees in Geomatics, so I applied to all of them. Amazingly, I was also accepted to all of them. Since Purdue has a reputation of being a top-level engineering school, I decided to attend Purdue in hopes of receiving a top-level education. As for hobbies, I have far too many to count. My sister jokes that my hobby is collecting hobbies. I really enjoy the outdoors, including hiking, climbing, camping, kayaking, etc. I also enjoy sports, most notably soccer.
